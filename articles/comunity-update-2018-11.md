# xel update
let's go for another writeup about xel !

### what append the last few week ?
We reconnected with ek in september, when the network was having a few technical issues (fork warnings detected by bittrex, leading to a wallet block).

ek asked for help setting up a new block explorer, and help he found !

Following that, i stayed in slack and discovered the discord server, and with it a lot of people ready to help the project in any way.

For the past few weeks, there has been a "community reboot" as i like to call it :)

### Since then, we :

- gained access to the official github to update all xel projects (https://github.com/xel-software)
- opened a community github for all community related projects (https://github.com/xel-community)
- opened a medium account in order to share updates and stories to the whole world (http://link.xel.org/medium)
- opened a new telegram channel to replace the previous one (http://link.xel.org/telegram)
- opened a new telegram chat to replace the old one (http://link.xel.org/telegram-chat)
- updated slack (http://link.xel.org/slack)
- created a small group of people to help organize the discord server (http://link.xel.org/discord)
- opened a brand new wiki (https://xelastic.wiki soon to be hosted to https://wiki.xel.org)
- opened a new community twitter account (https://twitter.com/xel_community)
- opened an investfeed account (https://link.xel.org/investfeed)
- started a monthly community-update on medium
- applied to Delta Direct and Blockfolio Signal to push more updates to the community
- made some tests on different platforms (mastodon, riot.im) to reach the community without access to discord

### More important, to avoid the confusion with existing products/brands in the same technical field, we decided to rebrand "elastic" to keep it simple, with "xel". That implies :
- renaming all git repositories
- updating the website (https://xel.org)
- updating the block explorer (https://explorer.xel.org)
- updating the wallets (https://wallet.xel.org)
- updating all social media accounts (the twitter accounts @elastic_coin and @elastic_comm will soon be renamed to @xel-project and @xel-community)
- reaching to Bittrex and CoinMarketCap to update the informations

### Regarding what has been produced by the community, here is a few things that have been done :

- all wallets have been updated (fixing the fork warning, rebranding to xel, automated installers with auto-update functionalities, docker based installer for servers)
- the block explorer has been refreshed (geolocation of nodes, fixed rich list, more last tx, performance)
- a new paper wallet has been created (https://github.com/xel-software/xel-paper-wallet)
- created a repository with tools for developers (https://github.com/xel-software/xel-developers-tools)
- created a media project with all necessary resources (https://github.com/xel-software/xel-medias)
- opened a contest to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem with a prize of 3000 XEL (https://github.com/xel-community/traveling-salesman-problem)
- reaching to the scientific community to gather great minds around the project
- having some new material about possible orientations for xel (https://medium.com/@tieandsuit/why-xel-community-have-to-concentrate-on-ga-algorithm-511969fac685)

### Here is a list of what is cooking :
- a new website
- a new block explorer
- new gui for the wallets
- 19+ translations for the wallets
- new developers resources and tutorials regarding ePL
- research on getting compatible with hardware wallets
- a few other things still too early to share !




## going forward

with all that in mind, remains the question of what's next ?

Well, here a few notes (everything that follow are personal notes, not speaking for the community) :

### a roadmap

with every crypto project there is talks about the roadmap. xel do not have one. is it a bad thing, good thing, who knows… if i had to make a list of what i (personally) want to see, here it is (extracted from a discord chat as-is) :

1/ Keep making the network stronger (having nodes more nodes) and making it more reactive (having nodes to auto-update, or being able to communicate directly to node so they update). This is critical to ensure that the day we need to push structural changes (computation plugin, merging the compute side chain) there won't be a fork needed.

2/ Making ePL easy to use and understand. I don't think there is many things more important than that at the moment. We could get more miners on board, yes. We could make shiny website, explorer, wallets, yes. But if nobody is capable of using xel for its main purpose, we basically have no client. And what happens to a company without any client ? Yes, xel have a working product, but who's is willing to use it today ?

3/ When ePL is easy to understand, reach out to people able/willing to use is to submit work

4/ Then, perfect time to get miners on board.

5/ We have people submitting work and miners ? Awesome, let's push our brand new wallet with the computation plugin !

6/ We have a wallet with shiny plugins ? Terrific, let's make more plugins for the new use-cases that our step 3 users are asking for !

7/ Damn, we have users, miners, a final wallet that we can extend without publishing new release (thanks to the plugins), a big community, what do we do now ??

my reasoning is the same since the beginning, we can build awesome tools but the only way to get the network strong and active is to have work submitted, that way miners are getting rewards, and forgers are getting rewards.


### what we need

in order to deliver this, we need a lot of things (kinda sorted by short-term -> long-term) :

- we need devs able to learn ePL and help use make more use cases, build a real knowledge base (there is already a great article https://xel.org/programming-first-steps/ but it needs to be more user friendly) so we can get people to actually use xel.
- devs with UX/UI skills. They can participate on the website, explorer, wallets.
- devs with good Java skill and most of all a good knowledge of the xel tech could be very useful to make real upgrades to the wallets
- content creators (designers, writers, community managers, …)

### what about the dev fund ?

For those who don't know it already, xel was not an ICO. This is a donation-based project, but sadly there is no more funds available (other will be able to share the full story).

How do we attract talented people considering this ? Few possibilities :

- counting on people working for free on the project
- sharing donation address for individuals devs and let the community reward them as they pleased
- creating some kind of dev fund to reward/pay for the work done by the community
- reaching to the community for people ready to fund specific tasks/projects

another angle i thought about is to create a public, task-based dev fund. the idea is to publish a new donation address for each medium/big project. every funds donated will be shared between all people that participated in the project (and maybe keep like 20% for a global dev fund).

that way, we can reward people for the time spent building things for xel, and also pay for outside help if needed.

There is no ideal solution to this, talking about rewards and money can always lead to difficult talks ^^
